# Telegram API WebServer in PHP/RDBMS
Web server to manage your Telegram bot (with its own Telegram API wrapper), written in PHP and SQL.

Useful to **integrate** Telegram API with **any client application** (Java Desktop, .NET apps, Android APKs, iOS apps, frontend AJAX requests, whatever) with a **RESTful web service** such as this web server; you can send messages, photos and receive data through/towards bot.

Useful if you want to **manage** a Telegram bot from a web server AND secure your key, using a VPS or any web hosting service (even free ones) that provides you PHP and any RDBMS.

Easy to use, to configure and lightweight.

## Requirements
1. **Any** web hosting service with **PHP+SQL plan** (Even free tier options, for example https://www.000webhost.com/ or https://it.altervista.org/ etc.);
2. The **API key of your Telegram bot** (Read Step 1 to discover how to create a bot: https://github.com/fabnicolas/telegram-bot-readytouse/blob/master/README.md)

## Setup (Web Server)
1. **Create** file `include/config.php` with the following content:
```php
<?php
return [
    'telegram_bot_API_key' => "your_key",
    'db_host' => "localhost",
    'db_user' => "your_username",
    'db_password' => "your_password",
    'db_name' => "your_database"
];
?>
```

2. **Run** https://your_url.com/install.php . It will **create the following table inside your database**:
```sql
updates(update_id, message_id, from_id, from_username, date, text)
```
...Ah, the installation script will self-destruct after use. *PHP magic. Don't worry - your server will not explode (I hope :P)*

3. **Start use the web server!**

## Understanding the project
The project consists on:
- A working web server that can be deployed where you want (On a web hosting service, or in local...);
- API wrapper classes:

-- **TelegramBot** (To manage bot);

-- **DB** (To interact with any SQL database);

-- **Uploader** (To upload media).


This web server offers built-in endpoints; if you are interested in a ready-to-use solution, routes are already set up.
Check "Web server endpoints" to have a detailed understanding on how to use those endpoints to integrate this server a REST service in your applications.

The offered endpoints actually supports:
- Sending messages to a particular user;
- Sending photos to a particular user;
- Getting incoming messages from a particular user.

If you want to customize behaviors - Check "Coded functionalities"; it provides you insights on how the code works, how you can rework it and how to use classes at your advantage to provide additional functionalities.


## Web server endpoints
The following endpoints were heavily tested with Advanced Rest Client. Postman is an equivalent.

Treat this server like a REST server.

As base URL we will consider https://your_url.com/ for examples.
Remember that each Telegram user has its own `chat_id`: for testing purposes, retrieve yours by contacting https://t.me/RawDataBot ; also remember the user you want to send requests to **must have `/start`-ed** your Telegram bot.

### Send a message
```
POST https://your_url.com/send_message.php
Body Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Payload: chat_id=YOUR_CHAT_ID; message: Your message
```
Answer (success):
```json
{status: 0, message: 'Message sent.'}
```
Effect: Telegram bot will send **"Your message"** to the given user with that `chat_id`.

### Send a photo
```
POST https://your_url.com/send_photo.php
Body Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Payload: chat_id=YOUR_CHAT_ID; image=[YOUR IMAGE]
```
Answer (success):
```json
{status: 0, message: 'Photo sent.'}
```
Effect: Telegram bot will send **the photo attached to the request** to the given user with that `chat_id`.

### Get incoming messages from a specific user
This is a wrapped and modified version of getUpdates Telegram API: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getting-updates

The wrapped version:
- **Simplifies** the original API by cutting unnecessary data for a client-to-bot successful communication, showing only `status` of the request, a `message` list and `next_update_id`;
- **Caches** info provided by the original API in a RDBMS. It's eventually possible to separate the caching process from the read requests themselves;
- **Provides** you the last `next_update_id` in a dedicated JSON attribute so that your application can make new requests without recalcolating the new `update_id` parameter.

**Notice**: `update_id` in the request payload should be implemented as follow:
- = `0` at start of your application;
- = `next_update_id` **of the previous request** to read newest possible messages beginning from that `update_id`.
```
POST https://your_url.com/get_updates.php
Body Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Payload: chat_id=YOUR_CHAT_ID; update_id=UPDATE_ID_CURRENT_VALUE
```
Sample answer (success):
```json
{
    status: 0, 
    message: [
        {
        "update_id": 100001,
        "text": "Hello! Are you there?"
        },
        {
        "update_id": 100002,
        "text": "Are you a bot?"
        }
    ],
    next_update_id: 100003
}
```
Effect: the effect is determined by your application *(That parses this JSON as an array of messages and decides what to do for each message)*.

## Coded functionalities
Make sure you use the following snippets when `TelegramBot` and `DB` objects are ready to use.
Copy `send_message.php` and use the copy as easiest template to extend functionalities.

### Send a message
```php
$chat_id=12345678; // Chat ID of the target the bot sends message to.
$telegram_bot->sendMessage("I'm a bot; I'll be loyal forever to you, unless you make me crash.", $chat_id);
```

### Send a photo
```php
$image_path='./image.png';  // Any path; send_photo.php contains an implementation to handle images sent by user
$chat_id=12345678; // Chat ID of the target the bot sends message to.
$telegram_bot->sendPhoto($image_path, $chat_id, function() use ($image_path){
	unlink($image_path); // Callback to remove image from web server after you sent it.
});
```

### Get incoming messages from users to Telegram bot
This code can turn useful in case you want to handle getUpdates API messages **in your way**.

**Be careful** to **NOT** expose this code as an endpoint for users; keep user privacy in mind.

This function without parameters will return the list of messages that every user sent **within 24 hours**.

The easiest way is:
```php
$result = $telegram_bot->getParsedUpdates();
if($result){
    foreach($result as $key=>$message){
    	// Analyze each $message as an array (update_id, message_id, from_id, from_username, date, text).
    }
}else{
    // No new messages incoming.
}
```
Check https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getting-updates , `get_updates.php` and `TelegramBot` class for more details about the structure and the underlying APIs.

In particular, `get_updates.php` is designed to read new messages from Telegram API, save them inside a database table, then read them - delete records read from the database - and send those back to the user.

The database structure is necessary in case you want to separate **caching script** (Using Telegram API and storing messages) from **reading script** (Reading from the database, sending data to the clients and deleting records read).



To retrieve more details and handle data *manually*:
```php
    // For some parameters details/usage, check get_updates.php, TelegramBot class and .
    $update_id=0;   // Update ID; clients send 0 the first time, then uses last possible number.
    $offset=0; // Optional, default 0; used to acknowledge messages. Read Telegram API for details.
    $limit=100; // Optional, default 100; used to limit the number of updates handled at the same time.
    $timeout=0; // Optional, default 0 (short polling); if you want to use long polling, set a value >0.
    $result = json_decode($telegram_bot->getUpdates($update_id));
    // Analyze the JSON structure to find interesting data.
```

### Get incoming messages from a specific user
This code is an extension of *"Coded functionalities -> Get incoming messages from users to Telegram bot"*.

You can expose this code as an endpoint for users but **keep in mind that it can be bruteforced to detect all messages sent by users within 24 hours**.

The easiest way is:
```php
$chat_id=12345678; // Chat ID of the messages sent by the target with that chat ID.
$result = $telegram_bot->getParsedUpdates($chat_id);
if($result){
    foreach($result as $key=>$message){
    	// Analyze each $message as an array (update_id, message_id, from_id, from_username, date, text).
    }
}else{
    // No new messages incoming from the target with that chat ID.
}

```
In alternative, use the customized approach to parse the JSON object and compare `from_id` values that matches a given `chat_id`.
